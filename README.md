- 👋 Hi, I’m @rambkk
- 👀 I’m interested in telecommunications, networking, programming, meditation, bicycling and anything that's fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things as I am helping in growing a local football club in Thailand.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solving difficult problems, impossible network requirements, algorithms, and any arbitrage opportunity.
- 📫 How to reach me ... can contact me via email ram @ pluslab.com
